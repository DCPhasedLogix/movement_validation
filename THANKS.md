### Schafer Lab ###

**[The Schafer Lab](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/)**, at the **[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)**, Cambridge, UK.

[**Dr. Eviatar "Ev" Yemini**](https://sites.google.com/site/openarchitecture1/3-contributors-and-syntax/ev-yemini) for all the original Matlab code built as part of [the WormBehavior database](http://wormbehavior.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/), written as part of his doctorate at the Schafer Lab.  Without him this project would not have been possible.

[**Dr. William "Bill" Schafer**](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/william-schafer/), Schafer Lab eponym, for allowing us to use and adapt Ev's code.

[**Dr. Andr√© Brown**](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/people2.html), post-doctoral scholar at the Schafer Lab, for contributions to the original Matlab code and for his work on behavioural motifs, which we hope to add.

[**Barry Bentley**](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?bb421), PhD student at the Schafer Lab, for his ongoing support of our use of their code.

### OpenWorm ###

[**Dr. Stephen Larson**](https://github.com/slarson), OpenWorm's project coordinator, for the original idea to adapt Ev's code and for encouragement and support.

**[The Movement Validation Team](https://github.com/orgs/openworm/teams/movement-validation):**

- [**Dr. James "Jim" Hokanson**](https://github.com/JimHokanson) for improving upon the original Matlab code, doing much of the translation of the code into this Python repository, overall architectural decisions and documentation.

- [**Michael Currie**](https://github.com/MichaelCurrie) for helping with the translation into Python, and helping with repository documentation.
