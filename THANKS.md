### Schafer Lab ###

**[The Schafer Lab](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/)**, at the **[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)**, Cambridge, UK.

[**Dr. Eviatar "Ev" Yemini**](https://sites.google.com/site/openarchitecture1/3-contributors-and-syntax/ev-yemini) for all the original Matlab code built as part of [the WormBehavior database](http://wormbehavior.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/), written as part of his doctorate at the Schafer Lab.  Without him this project would not have been possible.

[**Dr. William "Bill" Schafer**](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/william-schafer/), Schafer Lab eponym, for allowing us to use and adapt Ev's code.

[**Dr. André Brown**](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/people2.html), post-doctoral scholar at the Schafer Lab, for contributions to the original Matlab code and for his work on behavioural motifs, which we hope to add.

[**Barry Bentley**](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?bb421), PhD student at the Schafer Lab, for his ongoing support of our use of their code.

[**Dr. Tadas Jucikas**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjucikas), post-doctoral scholar at the Schafer Lab.

WT2 employs Java (version 1.6) for the tracking software and Matlab (version 2010a) for the analysis software. Standard Matlab functions are used along with the Image Processing, Statistics, and Bioinformatics toolboxes. Special thanks and acknowledgements are due to Christopher J. Cronin and Paul W. Sternberg for supplying the Matlab code from their publication "An automated system for measuring parameters of nematode sinusoidal movement" (Cronin et al. 2005). Joan Lasenby and Nick Kingsbury were an invaluable resource for computer vision questions. Andrew Deonarine, Richard Samworth, Sreenivas Chavali, Guilhem Chalancon, Sarah Teichmann, and Madan Babu provided a wealth of help and information for the bioinformatic clustering and statistics. Finally, thanks and acknowledgements are due for the following freely available code at the Matlab Central File Exchange (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/):

### OpenWorm ###

[**Dr. Stephen Larson**](https://github.com/slarson), OpenWorm's project coordinator, for the original idea to adapt Ev's code and for encouragement and support.

**[The Movement Validation Team](https://github.com/orgs/openworm/teams/movement-validation):**

- [**Dr. James "Jim" Hokanson**](https://github.com/JimHokanson) for improving upon the original Matlab code, doing much of the translation of the code into this Python repository, overall architectural decisions, documentation, and for his [Matlab Standard Library](https://github.com/JimHokanson/matlab_standard_library).

- [**Michael Currie**](https://github.com/MichaelCurrie) for helping with the translation into Python, and helping with repository documentation.
