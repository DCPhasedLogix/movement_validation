## Work Tracking Software Packages ##

1. WT 2.0 from [Dr William Schafer's lab](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/) at Cambridge University's MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology
 * NOTE: The OpenWorm team has chosen to adapt the codebase of this tracker for our movement validation functionality.

2. [3-D Worm Tracker for Freely Moving C. elegans](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3578814&tool=pmcentrez&rendertype=abstract)

3. [Track-A-Worm, An Open-Source System for Quantitative Assessment of C. elegans Locomotory and Bending Behavior](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0069653)
  * (We had [blogged about this one](http://blog.openworm.org/post/60312568840/ios-game-looks-to-kickstart-neuroscience-education) on 9 September 2013)
  * On 23 Feb 2014 Dr. Zhao-Wen Wang, the co-author of this system, sent us the [link to download the software](http://zwwang.uchc.edu/wormtrack/index.html).
  * The system can apparently handle most omega bends.  (although not the system linked to here; only the latest version which is available only by emailing Dr. Wang directly)
