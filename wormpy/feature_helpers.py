     Amplitude. 
     ------------------
     Worm amplitude is expressed in two forms: a) the maximum
     amplitude found along the worm body and, b) the ratio of the maximum
     amplitudes found on opposing sides of the worm body (wherein the smaller of
     these two amplitudes is used as the numerator). The formula and code originate
     from the publication âAn automated system for measuring parameters of
     nematode sinusoidal movementâ6.
     The worm skeleton is rotated to the horizontal axis using the orientation of the
     equivalent ellipse and the skeletonâs centroid is positioned at the origin. The
     maximum amplitude is defined as the maximum y coordinate minus the minimum
     y coordinate. The amplitude ratio is defined as the maximum positive y coordinate
     divided by the absolute value of the minimum negative y coordinate. If the
     amplitude ratio is greater than 1, we use its reciprocal.
  
     Wavelength
     ------------------------
     Wavelength. The wormâs primary and secondary wavelength are computed by
     treating the wormâs skeleton as a periodic signal. The formula and code
     originate from the publication âAn automated system for measuring
     parameters of nematode sinusoidal movementâ6. The wormâs skeleton is
     rotated as described above for the amplitude. If there are any
     overlapping skeleton points (the skeletonâs x coordinates are not
     monotonically increasing or decreasing in sequence -- e.g., the worm is
     in an S shape) then the shape is rejected, otherwise the Fourier
     transform computed. The primary wavelength is the wavelength associated
     with the largest peak in the transformed data. The secondary wavelength
     is computed as the wavelength associated with the second largest
     amplitude (as long as it exceeds half the amplitude of the primary
     wavelength). The wavelength is capped at twice the value of the wormâs
     length. In other words, a worm can never achieve a wavelength more than
     double its size.
  
     Tracklength
     -----------------------------
     Track Length. The wormâs track length is the range of the skeletonâs
     horizontal projection (as opposed to the skeletonâs arc length) after
     rotating the worm to align it with the horizontal axis. The formula and
     code originate from the publication âAn automated system for measuring
     parameters of nematode sinusoidal movementâ.

      Given x and y coordinates of the outline of a region of interest, fill
      the outline with a grid of evenly spaced points and use these points in
      a center of mass calculation to calculate the eccentricity and
      orientation of the equivalent ellipse.
   
      Placing points in the contour is a well known computer science problem
      known as the Point-in-Polygon problem.

      This function became a lot more complicated in an attempt to make it 
      go much faster. The complication comes from the simplication that can
      be made when the worm doesn't bend back on itself at all.

      xOutline : [96 x n_frames] The x coordinates of the contour. In particular the contour
                  starts at the head and goes to the tail and then back to
                  the head (although no points are redundant)

      N_ECCENTRICITY (a constant from config.py):
                 (scalar) The # of points to place in the long dimension. More points
                 gives a more accurate estimate of the ellipse but increases
                 the calculation time.

      =======================================================================
      eccentricity - [1 x n_frames] The eccentricity of the equivalent ellipse
      orientation  - [1 x n_frames] The orientation angle of the equivalent ellipse

      Eccentricity. 
      ------------------
      The eccentricity of the wormâs posture is measured using
      the eccentricity of an equivalent ellipse to the wormâs filled contour.
      The orientation of the major axis for the equivalent ellipse is used in
      computing the amplitude, wavelength, and track length (described
      below).
   
      Status
      =======================================================================
      The code below is finished although I want to break it up into smaller
      functions. I also need to submit a bug report for the inpoly FEX code.
